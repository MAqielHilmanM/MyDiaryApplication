    <string name="diary_content">The universe has a way of repeating itself until it\'s heard. Repeating loss. Repeating lessons. Repeating pain. I\'d give anything to literally implode this motherfucker with nothing but a lingering black hole left. This isn\'t to be confused with \"a bad day at work\" or \"waking up on the wrong side of the bed\". When I look back on my short 26 years on this Earth, I genuinely don\'t remember a moment when I actually wanted to be here. I\'ve always been incredibly out of place, you\'d think that I\'d have an idea of where I\'m supposed to be but honestly, I don\'t. I just know it isn\'t here. Yet here I am, still lingering out of orbit in this solar system, 26 years later. I\'ve called out to Anubis my entire life, yet he has never answered.</string>
